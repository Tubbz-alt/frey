# Changelog

## Ideabox

Unreleased and unplanned todos

- [ ] Consider detecting the User's config dir, and storing tools there, vs having a `~/.frey`
- [ ] Consider only source `*.frey.hcl` files, or using imports, so that random `*.hcl` isn't merged in.
- [ ] Ditch yargs for mimimist, now that we can have autocomplete via liftoff already
- [ ] Empty out and remove `Base` class?
- [ ] Figure out local Pip installs so we can build on Travis `sudo: false` platform
- [ ] Implement `commit`: Safely commit state automatically
- [ ] Indent stdout/err
- [ ] Mocha tests for `App`
- [ ] Mocha tests for `Base`
- [ ] Remote state in S3 feature
- [ ] Use Terraform modules similar to Ansible roles: https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html
- [ ] Vagrant support
- [ ] website: Console window like http://lebab.io/? Here's another: http://codepen.io/peiche/details/LNVYzJ/
- [ ] website: pitch: "don't hide away infra in obscure documentation, repos, datacenters, support desks. Evolve it together with your app"
- [ ] docs: since node is installed on Every Travis image, you can easily deploy go projects with frey http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31235146/how-to-run-node-js-and-ruby-tests-within-one-project-on-travis-ci
- [ ] docs: env secrets on Travis are not exposed to PRs from other repos: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/pull-requests
- [ ] Add generic cleanup method that `.pem` as well as `Frey-residu-*` can be registered with, so it will all be deleted if `global.purge_residu` is turned on (default = `true`)
- [ ] Don't rely on `exceptions` in `squashArrays`, but have a more clever system to preserve arrays (a better json2hcl or adhering to arrayed config might also fix this already, ridding ourselves from squash)

## v0.3.x

Released: Unreleased.

- [ ] Consider putting `provider` `output` `variable` `resource` at the root level, and removing intermediate `playbooks` level from `install`, `setup`, `backup`, `restore`, etc. This will simplify how the hcl looks, and (maybe) allow us to keep the hcl for terraform untouched, vs doing hcl->object->json (but what about injecting FREY vars..)
- [ ] Make Frey less 'classy', utilizing more pure functions, and allow the introduction of globals such as `runtime`
- [ ] allow Ansible and Terraform version override from config
- [ ] Check for `git ignore Frey-residu-*`
- [ ] Don't set default arguments for Apps so we can deprecate `SHELLARG_REMOVE`
- [ ] Offer cast5 encryption and decryption for `env.sh` (then remove `rebuild-env.sh` script from dependents)
- [ ] `Show` should use `terraformInventory` just like `Remote`, instead of `public_addresses`
- [ ] Speed up prepare by writing hashses do disk and comparing (just like depmake does)
- [ ] Symlink ansible if needed: `mkdir -p ~/.frey/tools/ansible/2.0.1.0/pip/bin/ && ln -nfs ~/.frey/tools/ansible/2.0.1.0/usr/local/share/python/ansible ~/.frey/tools/ansible/2.0.1.0/pip/bin/ansible && ln -nfs ~/.frey/tools/ansible/2.0.1.0/usr/local/share/python/ansible-playbook ~/.frey/tools/ansible/2.0.1.0/pip/bin/ansible-playbook`
- [ ] Deal with pip returning version `1.1` in some cases (we error out on that currently with an unrecognized version)
- [ ] Switch from terraformInventory to terraform-provisioner-ansible (https://github.com/jonmorehouse/terraform-provisioner-ansible)

## master

Released: TBA.
[Diff](https://github.com/freyproject/frey/compare/v0.3.31...master).

- [ ] Transpile `facts {` to an `provisioner "remote-exec"` block writing ini file into `/etc/ansible/facts.d/frey.fact`
- [ ] When `backup` is ran by hand, the chain should not be triggered. Yet when running a chain, `backup` should be part of it
- [ ] Add support for a `alienInventory` executable, that can cough up hostnames of existing infra
- [ ] When launching `frey` and we have no `FREY_` env keys, and we do `globSync` of `env*.sh` in the `cwd()` or `projectDir`, offer a list of which one to source automatically. Then inject these into the process.env(?)
- [ ] Frey should show debug output based on `-v` or `-vv` or `-vvv`. Because it's a tool, and not a library, we should ditch the `DEBUG` env var
- [ ] Upon `may i destroy infra?` question, Frey should show all the resource IDs that are getting destroyed
- [ ] Possible bug: We should likely not squashArray ansible actions such as `restart`, or actions in multiple files in the same dir are merged into one
- [ ] Offer to run `backup` if a destructive change was detected. Skip otherwise. Defaults to yes
- [ ] Ansible command output parsing is very basic, we can do a better job
- [ ] Fix bug where Frey won't show the error output when e.g. ansible cannot connect due to an invalid pem key (likely a scrolex issue)

- [x] Upgrade Ansible 
- [x] Replace mustache with lodash templating

- [x] Ansible must run from configBase
- [-] If you do a `frey install` you must trust that at least the Ansible files are re-compiled

- [x] Frey should traverse cwd upwards until it finds a Freyfile, and use that as default project dir
- [x] Switch to local npm install if available via LiftOff
- [x] Consider storing residu files in ~/.frey/tmp/

- [x] Test & document --no-colors
- [x] Implement a bailAfter, use it for DynamoDB scenario
- [x] Amazon free tier dynamodb Travis tests 
- [x] Runtime can be a step module, which can be prefixed to the runChain. Prepare can also be prepended to all. Afterwards, scenarios won't need to be ordered
- [x] `./Freyfile.toml` ? This means projectdir defaults to `.`, and .git check should traverse upwards 'indefinitely'
- [x] Move validation to Validate class
- [x] Port Prepare SSH Keys
- [x] Port refresh
- [x] Port plan
- [x] Port launch
