 › frey › refresh ›
   Empty or non-existent state file.

   Refresh will do nothing. Refresh does not error or return an erroneous
   exit status because many automation scripts use refresh, plan, then apply
   and may not have a state file yet for the first run.

   Saved state to '{root}/test/scenario/dynamodb/Frey-state-terraform.tfstate'
 › frey › plan ›
   The Terraform execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
   Resources are shown in alphabetical order for quick scanning. Green resources
   will be created (or destroyed and then created if an existing resource
   exists), yellow resources are being changed in-place, and red resources
   will be destroyed. Cyan entries are data sources to be read.

   Your plan was also saved to the path below. Call the "apply" subcommand
   with this plan file and Terraform will exactly execute this execution
   plan.
